<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS -->
<!--
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

## About The Project

1. Income and Expense List screen: </br>
● The screen will display a list of the expenses incurred and the income earned. For each entry there will be information with the name of the place related to the expense / income (e.g. Biedronka, Multikino, PJATK), the amount of the entry, date and category it concerns (e.g. food, health, fees, entertainment, etc.).</br>
● The screen should contain a summary expenses / income for the current month (sum of entries)</br>
● Selecting a list item will allow you to edit it, and holding it for a longer time will result in an alert asking you to delete the item. If the user confirms the deletion - the entry disappears from the list and the summary is updated.</br>
● The screen should also contain a button allowing to add a new entry and a button redirecting to the monthly statement. </br>
● Saving data is beyond the scope of this task. The introduced changes may restart each time the application is closed. </br>
2. Enter adding / editing screen - is activated after clicking the adding button or in case of editing an existing entry in the list. </br>
● This screen enables to add / change entry data and it contains a button saving the changes / data entered.</br>
